# Backend for Lecheelecci√≥n (Refactored)
## Concept
Initially this backend was written in Ruby on Rails (See the original [project](https://github.com/CaninoDev/lecheleccion)) As an exercise this is re-implemented in Go.
## Notes
Initially (and there is a branch for it), I attempted to set up a websocket server to serve data to the frontend. However this proved to be overkill for the scope of the project. Instead, a simpler RESTful server is implemented.
